		<h2>Top 8 most profitable IT companies in the world in 2021</h2>
		<div class="description">

		<h3>1. Dell Technologies$92 billion)</h3>
			<p>
			Industry: Computer software, cloud computing.
Market value: $55 billion
Employees: 165,000 people.

Today Dell is considered the most profitable IT company in the world. Its annual profit is $92 billion, and the number of customers worldwide exceeds the 10 million mark. Interestingly, almost 99% of Fortune 500 companies cooperate with this "IT" giant.

Dell was founded in 1984 by 19-year-old student Michael Dell. Then his main idea was to sell PCs with adaptive configurations — when buying, the client could choose any necessary components that would fully meet his individual needs.

Over time, the company has become one of the most popular manufacturers of PCs and equipment. But recently, thanks to its subsidiaries EMC, Pivotal, RSA, Secureworks, Virtustream, and VMware, it has begun to focus more on software, cloud storage, virtual reality, IT infrastructures, data centers and digital security.

In 2015, Dell acquired EMC for $67 billion, which is still considered one of the most expensive purchases in the IT industry.

The company operates in 180 countries around the world. The headquarters is located in Round Rock, Texas, USA.

			Industry: Cloud computing, AI, computer software.

IBM is the second most profitable IT company in the world with annual revenue exceeding $77 billion. And this is not strange, considering that almost 97% of the world's banks and 80% of retail companies use the products and services of this company.

The company International Business Machines (IBM) or "Blue Giant" (Big Blue), as it is sometimes called, was founded in 1911 by Charles Flint.

During its long history, IBM has given our world many great inventions, including floppy disks, hard drives, magnetic stripe on credit cards, barcode system and much more. By the way, the first ATM also appeared thanks to the company's mainframe.

Today, some of IBM's most popular services are related to cloud and cognitive computing, IT infrastructure, computer security, the Internet of Things, data analysis, blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI).

Cisco Systems is the third most successful IT company in the world by revenue. Its annual profit has already exceeded $50 billion. Cisco is usually known as a manufacturer of switches, routers and other network equipment.

But since 2015, the company has decided to delve into innovative areas related to software. Today Cisco is also engaged in the Internet of Things, cybersecurity, cloud computing, data centers and data analysis.

The company was founded in 1984 by Leonard Bosak and Sandra Lerner. They created a commercially successful multiprotocol router that connected previously incompatible computers and was built on the basis of the Stanford Blue Box Router.

Interestingly, in 2000 Cisco was the most expensive company in the world, thanks to the so-called Dot-com bubble. The company's market capitalization has reached a record high of $500 billion.

But the company is not going to stop there. The next priority and rather ambitious step for Accenture is quantum computing.

Today, the company serves customers from more than 120 countries. Accenture's customer base even includes such giants as Microsoft, Oracle and SAP.
