		<h3>1. Sony Alpha A7R III</h3>
			<p>
				Having received a number of improvements compared to its predecessor and pleased with its low cost (compared to Sony A9 Alpha), the 42.4-megapixel Alpha A7R III was named by Time as one of the best mirrorless cameras of 2021..

It has a higher resolution than the A9 and faster autofocus than the A7R II. The only thing the A9 can do against this is fast burst shooting.
				</p>
		</div>
       <div class="desc-right">
		<h3>2. Apple Watch 3</h3>
			<p>
				The latest version of the Apple Watch "tore the umbilical cord" that tied them to the iPhone. Now you can leave the house without a smartphone and continue to receive calls on your smartwatch. In addition, the Apple Watch 3 is connected to Apple Music, so you can not only ask your smart assistant Siri what time it is, but also ask her to play your favorite song.

		<h3>5. SNES Classic)</h3>
			<p>
				In 2021, the triumphant return of the once iconic Super Nintendo game console. Together with it, buyers receive 2 gamepads and 21 games.

Everything in this console, from the name of the games to tactile sensations, makes you remember the 90s with nostalgia and your first victories in the gaming field.

Experts of the research company NPD reported that the SNES Classic took second place in the list of the best-selling game consoles in November 2021. It is difficult to find it on sale, so buyers quickly "sweep" the SNES Classic off the shelves.

       <div class="desc-right">
		<h3>6. Galaxy S8</h3>
			<p>
		This is one of the best smartphones of 2021 for various reasons, but mainly thanks to the stunning 5.8-inch curved AMOLED display. Along with the Galaxy S8, most of the other mobile phones on the market look outdated. According to Ros Quality, it became the highest quality smartphone this year.

		<h3>7. Apple iPhone X</h3>
			<p>
				The new Apple smartphone took first place in the ranking of the best gadgets, because many of its features, including Face ID and frameless display, "will definitely set a new standard for phones in the future." On the one hand, the Face ID system has insecure vulnerabilities, and on the other hand, it is used more creatively than Samsung's main competitor (facial recognition technology). After all, Face ID can also be used by third-party applications, allowing, for example, to select glasses that match the shape of the user's face.

		<h3>8. Nintendo Switch</h3>
			<p>
	While this 6.2-inch modular gaming tablet can't compete with the power or multiplayer capabilities of its competitors, it offers a whole new approach to gaming.

At home, you can connect the Nintendo Switch dock to your TV and play on the big screen. The rest of the time, you can use the Nintendo Switch as a regular portable console. This "play anywhere, anytime" approach made the console a hit in 2021.
