		<h3>Beginning</h3>
			<p>
				Life in the XXI century is not at all like life in the XX century. We are surrounded by a lot of things that 20 years ago did not even exist yet, and then were perceived rather as fiction from the not very distant, but still the future. And now the future has come. What gadgets brought it closer and made it today? The editors of gg have collected their own top ten gadgets that have most influenced our lives in the new millennium.

       <div class="desc-right">
		<h3>Continuation</h3>
			<p>
				Of course, the choice was not easy, so we tried to select devices whose appearance changed our habits, our way of life and our attitude to technologies that have passed from the category of technomagic to everyday ones. Not all of them were the very first (they often had less successful or significant predecessors), but each, of course, left a bright mark in the history of mankind. All devices, for ease of perception, are listed in the order of their appearance.
