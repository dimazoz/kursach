		<h2>8 gadgets that changed life forever in the XXI century</h2>

		<h3>1. Ericsson HBH-10: The beginning of the Bluetooth era (1999)</h3>
			<p>
				It is a rare case when this particular headset was the very first Bluetooth headset in the world and was introduced back in the last millennium, on November 15, 1999. Its sales began in 2000, which, technically, is still the XX century, but the impact it has had on our world cannot be overestimated. And although Bluetooth headsets have not appeared for everyone, but no one has been surprised for a long time by the sight of a person walking down the street and talking as if to himself. At the time of its release, the number of Bluetooth-enabled phones could be counted on the fingers of one hand. Today, Bluetooth is in every smartphone and most push-button phones. The price has also decreased by an order of magnitude - today you can buy such a headset not for 200, but for $ 10.

		<h3>2. Segway: convenient personal transport of the XXI century (2001)</h3>
			<p>
				The word Segway originates in Italian and has to do with music: translated from Italian, the musical term "segue" literally means "follow, follow". This two-wheeled gyro scooter, which marked the beginning of an entire industry of personal electric transport (including gyro scooters and monowheels) was invented by American Dean Kamen. The first sales began in 2001, in 2002 Segway appeared in the Amazon online store and the whole world learned about this amazing device. Today, the inventor's legacy belongs to Ninebot, a company headquartered in China, its investors are the well-known Xiaomi and the venture fund Sequoia Capital. In the picture you can see the modern Segway x2 SE model, it is positioned for professional use (for example, they are used by the police at airports around the world). For the consumer market, this vehicle is still too expensive, but gyroscuters already cost quite reasonable money and in the summer season they sell relatively well for reasonable money — Ninebot models can be bought at the price of not the most expensive smartphone.

		<h3>3. Apple iPhone: The smartphone that made history (2007)</h3>
			<p>
				Of course, the first smartphone was not created by Apple. She didn't even make the first touchscreen phone. But for the whole world, it was the iPhone that opened the modern era of smartphones in the form in which we know it. Technically, the very first iPhone was not even a smartphone in the current sense of the term — the App Store App Store appeared only a year later, in 2008. But the first model was updated up to iOS version 3.1.3. Apple was the first to make a smartphone with a touch screen very easy to operate and realized that no stylus is needed to control it, and the interface needs to be adapted to control it with fingers. It was Apple that invented and implemented the well-known multi-touch gestures that have become so familiar today and forced the entire industry to switch from resistive to capacitive touch displays for this.

		<h3>4. Amazon Kindle: Digitized Library (2007)</h3>
			<p>
				Amazon Kindle was also not the first device for reading e-books, but it very successfully joined the structure of the largest online store in the world. For Amazon, the Kindle has become not just a product, but a distribution channel — through it, users buy books digitally by pressing a few buttons. Therefore, every single one of these devices is sold by Amazon, as, for example, Sony sells PlayStation, at a loss, with the expectation of returning everything with a vengeance on book sales. This creates difficulties for other manufacturers of e-book readers, since they have to sell their gadgets more expensive than the reference one. Kindle and similar devices have completely changed our habits. In the pre-digital era, to buy a book, you had to go to the store or, later, place an order online. Today we can choose a book, pay for the purchase and start reading within one minute. The picture shows the Kindle of the second generation (the tenth generation of this gadget is already being released). The very first kindle looks terrible by modern standards. And it was sold only in the USA. Over time, the Kindle lost its hardware keyboard, received a touch screen with built-in backlight and protection from water.

		<h3>5. Apple iPad: synonym of the word "tablet" (2010)</h3>
			<p>
				If the place of the iPhone in history can be disputed by individuals who deny the obvious, then everything is much easier with the iPad. This is also not the first tablet in the world, but the first device of this class, which showed everything that tablets can be capable of. The reason for its success in the market (since the launch of the iPad, it has been and remains the best and best-selling tablet in the world) is that Apple understood and accepted a simple (but still not obvious to everyone, as Microsoft's fruitless attempts indicate) thing: architecturally, the tablet is closer to the phone, not the desktop computer. Therefore, it should work on the mobile version of the operating system, just like a smartphone. This simple fact allows Apple to maintain market leadership for ten years, releasing a modern productive device with a long battery life and a much longer life cycle than competitors' devices.

		<h3>6. Prusa i3: The Power of Creation (2012)</h3>
			<p>
			Throughout its history, mankind has been producing new goods according to the principle formulated by the Renaissance sculptor Michelangelo Buonarroti: "I take a stone and cut off everything superfluous." This is how lathes and milling machines work, for example. The first experiments with additive technologies (that is, not cutting off everything superfluous, but, on the contrary, layer by layer increasing the necessary) appeared in the XX century. At the same time, the first 3D printers appeared, but in the current century, the capabilities of these devices (which are still quite expensive to manufacture and have not become as common in our homes, such as refrigerators and televisions) have become much more interesting. A round of popularity of 3D printers among enthusiasts was initiated by the RepRap project, whose goal was to popularize the technology and create an inexpensive 3D printer model, some of the components of which could be created using the printer itself. One of the key developers of RepRap, Josef Prusa, developed his own version of the printer and put it into production under the name Prusa i3 (it was implied that the first two were the RepRap Darwin and RepRap Mendel models). This happened in 2012 and since then the Prusa i3 and its analogues have been one of the most common 3D printers among enthusiasts of additive technologies and motion makers. Since 2017, this printer has been produced in the third, upgraded version and costs $ 749 in the form of an assembly kit or $ 999 assembled.

		<h3>7. Apple Earpods: the final solution to the issue of wires (2016)</h3>
			<p>
				Apple occupies three places in our top ten gadgets, but this only reflects its contribution to changing the world in the XXI century. The world is ruled by technology combined with design and usability. This is exactly what the Apple Earpods wireless headphones have become, which, as in all other cases, were not created by Apple at all. But it was these wireless headphones, released in 2016, that marked the beginning of the popularity of split Bluetooth headphones with independent batteries and a simple (for the user, but by no means simple from the point of view of technology — it's enough to remember that headphones are now required to synchronize sound with each other) connection to a smartphone.

		<h3>8. Oculus Rift: Change the World before You were Born (2016))</h3>
			<p>
		We started talking seriously about virtual reality after the release of the movie "Lawn Mower", where we could see what this technology would look like. Since then, virtual reality technologies, although they have grown out of children's pants, have not yet reached their peak. And the history of technology will not include the very first or even the most massive virtual reality helmet. Oculus Rift will go down in history as a unique project, first collecting two and a half million dollars in 2012 for a device that does not yet exist, and then bought by Facebook in 2014 for 2 billion (!) dollars. Despite the fact that even at the time of purchase, Oculus still did not have a working and selling (that is, generating revenue) device. This device has changed our world forever, existing only at the prototype stage, proving that the world in the XXI century lives and develops according to different principles than in the last century.
